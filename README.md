# Inner Sanctuary - Reparenting

An interactive and playful website on **Reparenting** - the act of healing the relationship between the adult you are today and the child you once were.

## What is Reparenting?

Reparenting is not just about changing your mind. It's about healing the relationship between the adult you are today and the child you once were. It's an emotional experience that involves replacing the critical inner voice with a nurturing one.

### Key Differences: Reframing vs. Reparenting

**The "Mind" Approach (Cognitive Reframing)**
- Logic-based interpretation
- Focuses on the present "Adult" perspective
- Goal: Objectivity & Fact-checking

**The "Heart" Approach (Reparenting)**
- Feeling-based connection
- Focuses on the "Inner Child's" unmet needs
- Goal: Safety, Validation & Soothing

> "Healing often requires both. You use the 'Adult Mind' to create safety so the 'Inner Child' can feel it."

## Features

### 🎯 Interactive Dialogue System
Select how you're feeling and receive compassionate responses:
- Unworthy / "Not Good Enough"
- Invisible / Ignored
- Overwhelmed / Scared
- Guilty / "I'm Bad"

For each feeling, the website provides:
- The old critic's voice (the harmful pattern)
- The wise parent's response (the healing message)
- A grounding action to practice

### 🌟 The Four Pillars of Reparenting

1. **Discipline** 🎯
   - Keeping promises to yourself
   - Setting boundaries and routines
   - Not punishment, but protection

2. **Joy & Play** 🎨
   - Reclaiming your spark
   - Doing things for fun, not productivity
   - Allowing yourself to be messy and creative

3. **Emotional Regulation** 🧘
   - Learning to soothe your nervous system
   - Breathing, grounding, and naming emotions
   - Safety in the body

4. **Self-Compassion** 🌸
   - The antidote to shame
   - Speaking to yourself with kindness
   - Validating your pain

### 📋 Daily Ritual

A simple 3-step practice to connect with yourself:
1. Place your hand on your heart and close your eyes
2. Ask internally: "What do you need right now?"
3. Wait for the answer and give it to yourself
